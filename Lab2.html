  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <p> Just a old soul wondering a beautiful planet called earth. 
      My motto for this life may be summed up in one quote, "If you can dream it, you can do it" byt Walt Disney.
      I am passionate about animation, coding, environmental studies and baking. 
      All of which I am trying refine but it is taking longer than expected.
      My professional experience involves talking to people all day however I can't say I'm a professional talker
      but I am working on that. 
      My ultimate goal for this life is realize all my goals and others but if you want further information you'll have to wait eventually.
